                                    —<b>Safiya Umoja Noble and Brendesha M. Tynes</b>, 2016, p. 1 </blockquote>

                            <p>As discussed, platform rhetorics are attuned to a complex assemblage of technological, cultural, political, ideological, and economic practices, an assemblage that is constantly in flux as technologies evolve and become more central to our personal, and therefore political, lives. Thus, we advocate for a technofeminist orientation to platform rhetorics research because technofeminist methodologies: are rooted in challenging and circumventing patriarchal research traditions that work to erase or distort heterogenous experiences; confront questions of the relationship between technology and gender and how women and other marginalized identities are excluded from technological design, materiality, and use; and account for the researcher’s experience with and position within the topic, acknowledging the congruent relationship between the personal and the political. In this section, then, we briefly outline such aspects of technofeminism while paying close attention to how intersectionality is crucial for examining the rhetorical dimensions of platforms. </p>
     
            
                          
                            <p>Judy Wajcman’s (2004) articulation of technofeminism described technology as “both a source and a consequence of gender relations. In other words, gender relations can be thought of as materialized in technology, and masculinity and femininity in turn acquire their meaning and character through their enrollment and embeddedness and working machines” (p. 107). A technofeminist framework is useful because putting “an emphasis on the contingency and the heterogeneity of technological change helps to locate its possibilities and wider social networks. Such an analysis introduces space for women’s agency in transforming technologies” (Wajcman, 2004, p. 7). As such, a technofeminist approach to platform rhetorics goes beyond merely critiquing platforms by seeking to alter the platform itself—its user cultures, labor practices, infrastructures, designs, and governances. Wajcman (2004) contended that “technology embody values, and have the potential to embody different values. The strength of feminism is that it is strongly attached to a rigorous social analysis—that is, one that meets certain evidence standards, yet always links research to a political practice of making a difference to the network and its effects” (p. 126-127). In the context of platform rhetorics, a researcher investigates how myriad aspects of the platform might be revised, challenged, or appropriated in ways that benefit the communities that are so often left out of platform design and governance.</p>
                            
                            <p>In rhetoric and writing studies, we’ve done much work to develop and refine (techno)feminist approaches to research in an effort to uncover what’s inevitably left covered by patriarchal research traditions (Blair, 2012; Lather, 1991; Takayoshi, 2000). Yet, feminist researchers regularly encounter questions of validity as they deviate from the patriarchal research traditions that are so commonplace in the academy. Jen Almjeld and Kristine Blair (2012), for example, highlighted a systemic problem within academia: that feminist research and methodologies are at risk of being deemed not academic enough to “count” as “real” research. Jacqueline Jones Royster and Gesa Kirsch (2012), Adrienne Rich (1995), and Sarah Ahmed (2017) have all noted this problem as well, with Ahmed commenting on women’s movements in academic research by drawing on Nirmal Puwar’s (2004) notion of “space invader:” a figure who enters “spaces that are not intended for them” (Ahmed, 2017, p. 9). Given how research mechanisms of the academy are patriarchal in nature and therefore position feminist research questions and methodologies as inferior, feminist researchers must become “space invaders.” We can occupy this role simply by referring to the wrong texts or by “asking the wrong questions” (Ahmed, 2017, p. 9). Indeed, a key goal of technofeminism is to expose “how the concrete practices of design and innovation [of technology] lead to the absence of specific users, such as women” (Wajcman, 2010, p. 150). This goal can be serviced by asking the wrong kinds of questions, and as we illustrate later in this webtext through our five tenets, we advocate for this very approach—in this context, “wrong,” of course, refers to questions that disrupt patriarchal methodologies by confronting structures that uphold and sustain systems of oppression on platforms.</p>
                            
                             

                            <p>Given how inquiry into platform rhetorics requires disruption of patriarchal systems, it’s crucial this work take an intersectional approach. Coined by Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw (1989), intersectionality critiques how theoretical frameworks of gendered oppression obfuscate race, thereby erasing or distorting Black women’s experiences. Frameworks of unitary gender oppression, Crenshaw pointed out, operate under a “single categorical axis,” and therefore contribute “to the marginalization of Black women in feminist theory and in antiracist politics” (p. 140). She wrote, <br>
                                <blockquote>Black women are sometimes excluded from feminist theory and antiracist policy discourse because both are predicated on a discrete set of experiences that often does not accurately reflect the interaction of race and gender. These problems of exclusion cannot be solved simply by including Black women within an already established analytical structure. Because the intersectional experience is greater than the sum of racism and sexism, any analysis that does not take intersectionality into account cannot sufficiently address the particular manner in which Black women are subordinated. (p. 140)</blockquote>
                             <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/web.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
                            By examining how white feminist movements, theories, and practices are built around the single axis of gender void of an acknowledgment of racial difference, Crenshaw exposed how equality and social justice, for many women, can never truly be achieved. When feminist movements, discourses, and research ignore racial difference, they uphold the very power structures they purport to resist. Accordingly, our methodology demands intersectionality. When we fail to recognize social divisions like race, class, ethnicity, nationality, sexuality, ability, and age (Berger & Guidroz, 2009, p. 1), we fail to understand how social injustices operate in complex ways that do recognize identity difference. By extension, a failure to develop intersectional understandings of how platforms sustain systems of oppression is a failure of efforts to dissolve such systems. </p>

                            <p>Technofeminist scholars have richly contributed to discussions of materiality (Reilly, 1994; Wajcman, 2002), design (Frost &amp; Haas, 2017; Herbst, 2009), technology use (Brady Aschauer, 1999; De Hertogh, 2015; Haas, Tulley, &amp; Blair, 2002), and social media (Hidalgo &amp; Grimes, 2017). Extending on this important work, we contend throughout this webtext that inquiry into platform rhetorics should avoid the trap of understanding our digital spaces and practices as wholly optimistic or pessimistic. Instead, we take cues from Wajcman who offered “a way between utopian optimism and pessimistic fatalism for technofeminism, and between cultural contingency and social determinism in social theory” (2002, p. 6). Ultimately, our goal in taking a technofeminist approach to platform rhetorics is to unmask and work to change how platforms structure and reproduce conditions that have great effect on marginalized populations. In the next section and its subsections, we detail applications of such an approach. </p>
