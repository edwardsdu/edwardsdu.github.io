							<h1>Platform Rhetorics</h1>
							
                            <p>A seemingly simple but deceptively complex question: what is a platform? Media theorists José Van Dijck and Thomas Poell (2016) defined platforms as “online sites that facilitate and organize data streams, economic interactions, and social exchanges between users” (p. 2). As their baseline definition attests, platforms operate at various conceptual levels simultaneously—computational, economic, and social. As such, platforms matter in different ways to different stakeholders. Moreover, Van Dijck and Poell’s definition indicates that platforms exert a sense of agency—they “facilitate and organize” backstage data practices, economic exchanges, and social interactions. Through particular practices, platforms make decisions and act in ongoing ways that are sometimes difficult to isolate. As the notion of “a platform” has slowly emerged (in these overlapping and sometimes contested senses), it comes as no surprise that scholars from a range of disciplinary backgrounds have developed theories and methodologies to come to grips with how to tackle the question of the platform. </p>
                            
                             <p><span class="image main"><img src="images/socialnetworks.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                          
                            <p>Of course, part of the trouble in studying platforms lies in the term itself. As media scholar Tarleton Gillespie (2010) has argued, the competing meanings of term platform often work to the advantage of commercial entities such as YouTube, Facebook, and others. Such corporate firms, Gillespie argued, “position themselves both to pursue current and future profits, to strike a regulatory sweet spot between legislative protections that benefit them and obligations that do not, and to lay out a cultural imaginary within which their service makes sense” (p. 348). For Gillespie, the notion of the platform depends on four semantic meanings: computational (pertaining to the technical infrastructures of code, software, and hardware), architectural (referring to a raised material surface), figurative (describing a sense of opportunity or optimism), and political (naming a set of ideological beliefs or principles). The polysemic character of a “platform” has thus lead to a complex terrain—not only for users but also for scholars attempting to unpack characteristics of sociotechnical configurations that have come to matter a great deal in realms of politics, education, finance, criminal justice, media circulation, and more. </p>
                            
                            <p>On the computational end of the spectrum, Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost (2009) have situated the platform within a greater matrix of studying digital media. Montfort and Bogost’s call for “platform studies” situates the platform as the bottom layer of digital media (other layers include issues of reception/operation, the interface, form/function, and code). For Montfort and Bogost, the platform is a layer of digital media that concerns itself with computing systems and architectures. Yet, they stressed, “a computational platform is not an alien machine, but a cultural artifact that is shaped by values and forces and which expresses views about the world” (p. 148). Montfort and Bogost’s attention to cultural values and forces is crucial, because it underscores that platforms are not mere computational intermediaries divorced from broader culture; they are products of culture. </p>
                            
                            <p>In a more technical sense, other takes on computation insist that a platform represents the infrastructure upon which third parties may develop other applications and programs. In this sense, the platform enjoys a privileged position: it requires application developers to make their programs “platform ready” (Helmond (2015)—meaning, configuring applications to share data streams with the platform upon which it operates. For example, when an online game such as Candy Crush Saga runs on the Facebook platform, the owner of the app, Activision Blizzard, must grant Facebook access to its data. This is a fairly new model of web development that has helped a select few platforms—Facebook, Google, Amazon—dominate in the emerging platform economy. </p>
                            
                            <p>Indeed, such technical depictions—accessing and using data streams—also help describe the economic dimension of platforms. Nick Srnicek (2017) has argued that advanced capitalism today has turned to data as material to boost economic growth and vitality in the otherwise sluggish web development sector. As the rise of Big Data indicates (see, e.g., boyd &amp; Crawford, 2012), data have become an increasingly important commodity (especially if collected in mass quantities). As Srnicek put it, “just like oil, data are a material to be extracted, refined, and used in a variety of ways. The more data one has, the more uses one can make of them” (p. 40). And so describes the fundamental economic dimension of platforms: it is in their best financial interests to grow their data pools, to collect copious amounts of data that can be used for new purposes. The task, as we see it, is to study platforms not as static technical entities but as a moving assemblage with deeply embedded cultural biases.</p>

                            <p>Our own field of rhetoric and composition—and particularly, computers and writing—has long argued that technology is never neutral nor passive (Banks, 2006; Gruwell, 2015; Janangelo, 1991; Selfe, 1999; Wysocki &amp; Jasken, 2004). Consider, for example, a trio of articles that questioned the politics of particular software developments in the 1990’s and early 2000’s. In 1994, Cynthia Selfe and Richard Selfe published their landmark article, “The Politics of the Interface: Power and Its Exercise in Electronic Contact Zones,” which questioned how computer interfaces reinscribed cultural biases and legacies of domination and colonialism through its “default” designs. Noting how computer interfaces privilege particular identities—white, male, English-speaking, corporate class—Selfe and Selfe pushed for the work of unconcealing the values and epistemological violences implicitly and explicitly embedded in digital technologies. Similarly, Joel Haefner (1999) extended Selfe and Selfe’s work by examining the politics of computer code, arguing that code represents “a new kind of cultural imperialism” (p. 325). In 2002, Tim McGee and Patricia Ericsson pointed out the politics and hegemony of one particular program, Microsoft Word and its Grammar Checker software. In all, such attention to the politics of interfaces, code, and programs seeks to question the assumptions, biases, and erasures that are embedded in technologies and our everyday use with them. </p>
                            
                            <p> We follow such work with a new angle: from the politics of the interface, code, and program, to the politics—and, for us, the rhetorics—of the platform. We use the phrase platform rhetorics as a kind of shorthand to recognize the multidimensional suasive effects of platforms. Platforms are sites for rhetorical action but also determine the contours of that action. On the one hand, platforms are sites for rhetorical delivery and represent a modern-day version of the Roman rostra. On the other hand, platforms are themselves rhetorical. Not only are platforms rhetorical in the sense that they occupy a public imaginary that is discursively constructed via carefully crafted public personas, but they are also rhetorical in that their decisions produce effects in the world.  Platforms are complex and evolving assemblages of people, technologies, discourses, materialities, financial decisions, community practices, etc. that shape the possibilities for social, civic, and political exchanges. Platforms, then, are rhetorical infrastructures that host and shape the production and circulation of content.</p>

                            <p>Before moving any further, we want to address an issue with attribution: calling a platform a a platform or a nondescript “they” might seem to downplay the human element that is always at play when constructing (discursively and materially) these sites and services. That is not our intention. We recognize that it is humans who write the business plans, the code, and the algorithms on which platforms are built. Yet, because platforms are in a constant state of update and revision, evolving and adjusting to community and market pressures through complex computational procedures, we find the notion of assemblage to be a more useful descriptor for understanding the suasive force of platforms. To call an entity an assemblage is to point out the impossibility of isolating discrete parts of complex systems or networks. As Jodie Nicotra (2016) has argued, “attuning to assemblages helps us reconceive rhetorical action as something that requires a deliberate and intentional attention to all of the elements of the system (both human and nonhuman, organic and inorganic) in which one hopes to intervene, an attention gained through repeated interaction and empirical observation and experimentation” (p. 187-188). Assemblage thinking, as Nicotra termed it, resists the god’s eye view of understanding complex systems and phenomena: it starts, instead, in the middle, in media res, and works to notice uneven relations as they emerge. Bringing this kind of thinking to bear on platforms is not to somehow forget humans, but to think more deeply about avenues of ethical response. </p>
