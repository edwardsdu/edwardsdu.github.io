                            <p>In many ways, this webtext is a continuation of a research agenda we called for in a special issue we co-edited for Present Tense: A Journal of Rhetoric in Society. In the introduction to that special issue, “The Rhetorics of Platforms: Definitions, Approaches, Futures,” we set out to “recognize the multidimensional suasive forces and effects of platforms” (Edwards &amp; Gelms, 2018, n.p). We defined platforms as “complex and evolving assemblages of people, technologies, discourses, materialities, financial decisions, community practices, and more that shape the possibilities for social, civic, and political exchanges” (n.p.). In short, we positioned platforms as rhetorical infrastructures that both host and shape content through various sociotechnical interventions. We qualified our discussion by drawing on a range of interdisciplinary scholars (Gillespie, 2010; Helmond, 2015; Montfort &amp; Bogost, 2009; Srnicek, 2017; van Dijck &amp; Poell, 2016), and especially noted the computational, economic, and social aspects of platforms.  </p>
                            
                          
                            <p>Our point was that such overlapping—and sometimes competing—conceptions of platforms point to the difficulties in understanding their role in current technocultures. As media scholar Tarleton Gillespie (2010) has argued, the competing meanings of term itself often work to the advantage of commercial entities such as YouTube, Facebook, and others. Such corporate firms, Gillespie argued, “position themselves both to pursue current and future profits, to strike a regulatory sweet spot between legislative protections that benefit them and obligations that do not, and to lay out a cultural imaginary within which their service makes sense” (p. 348). For Gillespie, the notion of the platform depends on four semantic meanings: computational (pertaining to the technical infrastructures of code, software, and hardware), architectural (referring to a raised material surface), figurative (describing a sense of opportunity or optimism), and political (naming a set of ideological beliefs or principles). The polysemic character of a “platform” has thus lead to a complex terrain—not only for users but also for scholars attempting to unpack characteristics of sociotechnical configurations that have come to matter a great deal in realms of politics, education, finance, criminal justice, media circulation, and more. </p>

                            <p>Our discussion of the rhetorics of platforms was an attempt to explicitly name a trajectory of research for  rhetoric and writing studies. Yet, in this webtext, we want to more directly point out how this trajectory is indebted to critical work in computers and writing, with much of its foundational threads knotted to what we understand as technofeminist in orientation. For example, Cynthia Selfe and Richard Selfe’s (1994) landmark article, “The Politics of the Interface: Power and Its Exercise in Electronic Contact Zones,” questioned how computer interfaces reinscribed cultural biases and legacies of domination and colonialism through its “default” designs. Noting how computer interfaces privilege particular identities (e.g., white, male, English-speaking, corporate class), Selfe and Selfe pushed for the work of unconcealing the values and epistemological violences implicitly and explicitly embedded in digital technologies. More recently, scholars have developed critical awareness about issues such as algorithmic surveillance (Beck, 2015, 2017; Beck et al., 2016), toxic online cultures (Sparby, 2017; Trice &amp; Potts, 2018; Vie, Balzhiser, &amp; Ralston, 2014), and researcher positionality (Gruwell, 2018) in an age of platforms. Taken together, such critical work has aimed to question the defaults, assumptions, biases, and erasures that are embedded in technologies and our everyday use of them.</p>
                            
                            <p>Similarly, technofeminist scholars have richly examined technologies and the role they play in our everyday lives through discussions of, for example, materiality (Reilly, 2004; Wajcman, 2004), design (Frost &amp; Haas, 2017; Herbst, 2009), and technology use and interaction (Brady Aschauer, 1999; De Hertogh, 2015; Haas, Tulley, &amp; Blair, 2002; Hidalgo &amp; Grimes, 2017). Further, technofeminist approaches aim to uncover the assumptions, biases, and erasures that are oftentimes left covered by patriarchal research traditions (Blair, 2012; Takayoshi, 2000). Jen Almjeld and Kristine Blair (2012), for example, noted that feminist researchers regularly encounter questions of validity as they deviate from the patriarchal research traditions that are so commonplace in the academy. In short, feminist research and methodologies are at risk of being deemed not academic enough to “count” as “real” research. </p>
                            
                            <p>Jacqueline Jones Royster and Gesa Kirsch (2012), Adrienne Rich (1995), and Sarah Ahmed (2017) have all noted this problem as well, with Ahmed commenting on women’s movements in academic research by drawing on Nirmal Puwar’s (2004) notion of “space invader:” a figure who enters “spaces that are not intended for them” (Ahmed, 2017, p. 9). Given how research mechanisms of the academy are patriarchal in nature and therefore position feminist research questions and methodologies as inferior, feminist researchers must become “space invaders.” We can occupy this role simply by referring to the wrong texts or by “asking the wrong questions” (Ahmed, 2017, p. 9). Indeed, a key goal of technofeminism is to expose “how the concrete practices of design and innovation [of technology] lead to the absence of specific users, such as women” (Wajcman, 2010, p. 150). This goal can be serviced by asking the wrong kinds of questions. In this context, “wrong,” of course, refers to questions that confront structures that uphold and sustain systems of oppression on platforms—the kinds of questions that have guided work in computers and writing that argue technology is never neutral nor passive (Banks, 2006; Gruwell, 2015; Janangelo, 1991; Selfe, 1999; Wysocki &amp; Jasken, 2004). 
</p>

                            <p>Our own field of rhetoric and composition—and particularly, computers and writing—has long argued that technology is never neutral nor passive (Banks, 2006; Gruwell, 2015; Janangelo, 1991; Selfe, 1999; Wysocki &amp; Jasken, 2004). Consider, for example, a trio of articles that questioned the politics of particular software developments in the 1990’s and early 2000’s. In 1994, Cynthia Selfe and Richard Selfe published their landmark article, “The Politics of the Interface: Power and Its Exercise in Electronic Contact Zones,” which questioned how computer interfaces reinscribed cultural biases and legacies of domination and colonialism through its “default” designs. Noting how computer interfaces privilege particular identities—white, male, English-speaking, corporate class—Selfe and Selfe pushed for the work of unconcealing the values and epistemological violences implicitly and explicitly embedded in digital technologies. Similarly, Joel Haefner (1999) extended Selfe and Selfe’s work by examining the politics of computer code, arguing that code represents “a new kind of cultural imperialism” (p. 325). In 2002, Tim McGee and Patricia Ericsson pointed out the politics and hegemony of one particular program, Microsoft Word and its Grammar Checker software. In all, such attention to the politics of interfaces, code, and programs seeks to question the assumptions, biases, and erasures that are embedded in technologies and our everyday use with them. </p>
                            
                            <p> This line of scholarship is especially congruent for researching platform rhetorics via an intersectional approach (Crenshaw, 1989). Given the rhetorical nature of platforms and the capacity for the companies in Silicon Valley to privilege white (Noble, 2018), straight/homonormative (Faris, 2018), and middle-upper class identities (Eubanks, 2018), an intersectional technofeminist approach can bring to light social inequalities along many axes of difference. We firmly maintain that when we fail to recognize social divisions like race, class, ethnicity, nationality, sexuality, ability, and age (Berger &amp; Guidroz, 2009, p. 1) in our work on platforms, we fail to understand how social injustices predicated on difference operate in the complex ways that lord power over marginalized groups. By extension, a failure to develop intersectional understandings of how platforms sustain systems of oppression is a failure of efforts to dissolve such systems.</p>

                            <p>Further, we contend throughout this webtext that inquiry into platform rhetorics should avoid the trap of understanding our digital spaces and practices as wholly optimistic or pessimistic. Instead, we take cues from Wajcman who offered “a way between utopian optimism and pessimistic fatalism for technofeminism, and between cultural contingency and social determinism in social theory” (2004, p. 6). Like Wajcman, ultimately our goal in taking a technofeminist approach to platform rhetorics is to unmask and work to change how platforms structure and reproduce conditions that have great effect on marginalized populations. In the next section and its subsections, we detail five tenets of inquiry that further explain this approach. </p>
